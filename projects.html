        <h2>Our Classroom</h2>
        <p>Android application</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our classroom is targeted towards helping teachers 
            to update parents of their child in school. Teachers are able
            to upload photos of the students in class, where parents can like and 
            comment on the photos. Private chat is also available between teacher and parent
            without the need to share their contact number. 
        </p>
        <p>It is challenging to do the researching analysis to design 
            and development within a short period of time, but it is definitely
            rewarding in the end to produce the prototype!
